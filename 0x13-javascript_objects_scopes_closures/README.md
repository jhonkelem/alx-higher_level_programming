JavaScript Objects, Scopes and Closures

js-semistandard-style



This project contains some tasks for learning about objects, scopes, and closures in JavaScript.



Tasks To Complete

 0. Rectangle #0

0-rectangle.js contains an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:



You must use the class notation for defining your class.

 1. Rectangle #1

1-rectangle.js contains a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:



You must use the class notation for defining your class.

The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h.

Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.

Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.

 2. Rectangle #2

2-rectangle.js contains a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:



You must use the class notation for defining your class.

The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h.

Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.

Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.

If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

 3. Rectangle #3

3-rectangle.js contains a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:



You must use the class notation for defining your class.

The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.

Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.

Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.

If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.



 4. Rectangle #4

4-rectangle.js contains a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:



You must use the class notation for defining your class.

The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.

Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.

Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.

If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.

Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.

Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.

 5. Square #0

5-square.js contains a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:



You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends.

The constructor must take 1 argument: size.

The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super()).

 6. Square #1

6-square.js contains a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:



You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends.

Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c.

If c is undefined, use the character X.

 7. Occurrences

7-occurrences.js contains a function that returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list:



Prototype: exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement).

 8. Esrever

8-esrever.js contains a function that returns the reversed version of a list:



Prototype: exports.esrever = function (list).

You are not allowed to use the built-in method reverse.

 9. Log me

9-logme.js contains a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.



Prototype: exports.logMe = function (item).

Output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>.

 10. Number conversion

10-converter.js contains a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument:



Prototype: exports.converter = function (base).

You are not allowed to import any file.

You are not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc..).

 11. Factor index

100-map.js contains a script that imports an array and computes a new array.



Your script must import list from the file 100-data.js.

You must use a map.

A new list must be created with each value equal to the value of the initial list, multipled by the index in the list.

Print both the initial list and the new list.

 12. Sorted occurences

101-sorted.js contains a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.



Your script must import dict from the file 101-data.js.

In the new dictionary:

A key is the number of occurrences.

A value is the list of user ids.

Print the new dictionary at the end.

 13. Concat files

102-concat.js contains a script that concats 2 files.



The first argument is the file path of the first source file.

The second argument is the file path of the second source file.

The third argument is the file path of the destination.
